AI #11: is your final assignment. Due at 9am on Thursday, 5 Dec.
Create a predator and a prey for the predator/prey competition in class on 5 Dec. You can only modify grid-get-next-robot.ss and grid-get-next-goal.ss. Rename them both with your name in front of grid. You have two new functions at your disposal (build and blast). You may modify both the robot and goal controllers with the following restrictions: build can build an obstacle at any adjacent node, but only one during a turn, and the agent cannot move during that turn; blast can blast away any and all adjacent obstacles (change the obstacle nodes into a free nodes) and the agent cannot move during that turn. Any functions within your code, except get-next-robot and get-next-goal, must begin r if in the robot file and g if in the goal file. Other than build and blast, your program cannot alter the grid or your opponent. Your programs will be graded on the speed (no excessive delays in movement), uniqueness, and effectiveness of your controller. This is not intended to be a repeat of the game playing assignment, although you may use Monte Carlo or minimax up to 3 plys. For the best grade, make use of other AI methods, such as NNs, CBR, or production systems. You can be in teams of up to 4 people, with your team writing controllers for both a predator and a prey. See the following for some starting code:
grid-chase.ss
grid-class.ss
grid-draw.ss
grid-get-next-goal.ss
grid-get-next-robot.ss
grid-main.ss
grid-make.ss
grid-new.ss
grid-priority-queue.ss
Do the 3 questions on the sum of the topics we've covered in the class.
